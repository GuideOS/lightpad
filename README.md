## Compilation

   > **NOTE**: packaging files are now tracked in a separated [packaging](https://github.com/libredeb/lightpad/tree/packaging) branch.

   1. Install dependencies:
   * For Ubuntu:
      ```sh
      sudo apt-get install meson ninja-build libgee-0.8-dev libgnome-menu-3-dev cdbs gettext valac libvala-*-dev libglib2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev python3 python3-wheel python3-setuptools gnome-menus
      ```
   * For Fedora:
      ```sh
      sudo dnf install meson ninja-build libgee-devel gnome-menus-devel cdbs gettext vala libvala-devel glib2-devel gtk3-devel python3 python3-wheel python3-setuptools gnome-menus
      ```
   * For Arch Linux:
      ```sh
      sudo pacman -Sy meson ninja libgee gnome-menus gettext vala glib2 gdk-pixbuf2 gtk3 python python-wheel python-setuptools
      ```
   2. Clone this repository into your machine
      ```sh
      git clone https://github.com/libredeb/lightpad.git
      cd lightpad/
      ```
   3. Create a build folder:
      ```sh
      meson setup build --prefix=/usr
      ```
   4. Compile LightPad:
      ```sh
      cd build
      ninja
      ```
   5. Install LightPad in the system:
      ```sh
      sudo ninja install
      ```
   6. (OPTIONAL) Uninstall LightPad:
      ```sh
      sudo ninja uninstall
      ```

## Post Install

Once installed set shortcut key to access LightPad.

  * `System -> Preferences -> Hardware -> Keyboard Shortcuts` then click on `Add` button
  * **Name:** LightPad
  * **Command:** io.github.libredeb.lightpad

Now assign it a shortcut key, such as `CTRL`+`SPACE`.

> **NOTE:** if you want to use another keyboard shortcut like the `SUPER` key to activate LightPad in Desktop Environments in which the `SUPER` key is used, maybe you want to try to disable it first. For example in GNOME Shell you can run next command `gsettings set org.gnome.mutter overlay-key ''` (and if you want to restorte the original behavior, so run next command `gsettings reset org.gnome.mutter overlay-key`).

## Optional Features

Explore LightPad's optional features to personalize your experience! For a full list of available options and their descriptions, run `io.github.libredeb.lightpad --help` in your terminal. Or refer to the binary manual page by using the following command `man io.github.libredeb.lightpad`.

### Custom Configuration Support 

- **Generate a template file (-s, --save-config)**

   LightPad supports customization through a simple configuration file.  
   You can adjust visual aspects such as font size, icon size, and the application grid layout.

   To get started, generate a configuration template so that you can edit the parameters later:

   ```sh
   io.github.libredeb.lightpad --save-config
   ```

- **Clear the configuration file (-c, --clear-config)**

   You can also clear the generated custom settings file so that LightPad uses the values that best fit your display by executing the command:

   ```sh
   io.github.libredeb.lightpad --clear-config
   ```

### Dynamic Background (-b, --background)

LightPad now supports using a custom background of your choice. You can use any wallpaper of your choice and LightPad will use them (prioritizing the JPG format):

```sh
io.github.libredeb.lightpad --background /path/to/image[.jpg|.png|.webp]
```

### Blocklist File

Another new functionality is the ability to hide applications using a blocklist file. In the file.

In the file:

> `$HOME/.lightpad/blocklist`

You must add line by line the full name of the binaries of the applications you want to hide in LightPad. For example:
```
nautilus
rhythmbox
gnome-screenshot
gnome-terminal
firefox
htop
/usr/bin/gparted
/usr/bin/vlc
```

These lines appear in the **.desktop** files located in `/usr/share/applications` as the value of the **Exec=** tag.

## Icon Cache

To improve startup performance, LightPad now implements a persistent icon cache.

- **Location:**  
  The cache is located in `$HOME/.lightpad/cache/`.

- **How it works:**  
  On first launch, LightPad loads and scales each application icon, saving a PNG version in the cache directory. On subsequent launches, icons are loaded directly from the cache, significantly reducing startup time.

- **Cache invalidation:**  
  If an application icon changes on the system, the cached version will not be updated automatically. To refresh the cache, simply delete the contents of `$HOME/.lightpad/cache/` and restart LightPad.

- **Troubleshooting:**  
  If you experience missing or outdated icons, try clearing the cache directory and relaunching LightPad.

## Debug LightPad

To show debug messages to see what's happening when LightPad run, you can execute next command:

```sh
pkill -f io.github.libredeb.lightpad; G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all io.github.libredeb.lightpad
```

## Translations

To add more supported languages, please, edit [LINGUAS](./po/LINGUAS) file and update the translation template file (a.k.a. `pot`) running next command:
```sh
cd build
ninja io.github.libredeb.lightpad-pot
```

And for generate each LINGUA `po` file, run next command:
```sh
ninja io.github.libredeb.lightpad-update-po
```
